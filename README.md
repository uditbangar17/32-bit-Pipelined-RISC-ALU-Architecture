# Design & Optimization of a 32-bit Pipelined RISC Processor

## Overview

This project focuses on the *RTL design, optimization, and verification of a 32-bit Arithmetic Logic Unit (ALU)* and its integration into a *5-stage pipelined RISC processor*.  
The design emphasizes *performance optimization, modular architecture, and pipeline correctness*, making it suitable for graduate-level computer architecture coursework and research-oriented study.

The processor is implemented in *Verilog HDL* and follows a classical RISC pipeline structure with additional support for *data hazard detection and forwarding*.
